                    as applicable, but is simply intended to provide additional information to you regarding the

                <p>“Personal Data” means any information relating to you that is entered by or on behalf of your Company
                    or its authorized users of the VIZI Tech Solutions Services into or derived from their use of the
                    VIZI Tech Solutions Services. It also includes personal data supplied to or accessed by or on behalf of
                    VIZI Tech Solutions to provide support for VIZI Tech Solutions Services. Not all of your Company’s data within the
                    VIZI Tech Solutions Services is Personal Data. As a general matter, Personal Data in the VIZI Tech Solutions
                    Services includes the following categories of data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal profile data, such as name, contact information, travel preferences, financial
                        information and account numbers for related connected services</li>
                    <li>Organizational information, such as employee identification, payroll, cost center, associated
                        approvers information</li>
                    <li>Expense and travel related data, such as expense information, including images of receipts, and
                        travel itineraries</li>
                    <li>Mobile data, such as mobile device information and, when enabled, location data</li>
                    <li>Data for associated connected services to support travel needs, such as account, loyalty program
                        or rewards numbers for taxi or rental cars, airlines or hotels</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The categories of information about you collected or derived within the VIZI Tech Solutions Services depend,
                    in part, on the VIZI Tech Solutions Services to which your Company has subscribed and how the VIZI Tech Solutions
                    Services are configured for your Company.</p>
                <p>You provide Personal Data directly when you enter it in VIZI Tech Solutions Services. In some cases, another
                    user, such as an account administrator, may create an account on your behalf or may provide Personal
                    Data as part of your use of the VIZI Tech Solutions Services at the direction or with permission of your
                    Company.</p>
                <p>VIZI Tech Solutions Services may obtain Personal Data from other sources, as well, such as back office
                    financial or human resources systems, or from travel agents and travel management companies that
                    work with your Company. VIZI Tech Solutions Services also connect to third party partners and suppliers like
                    airlines, hotel chains, restaurant chains or ride-sharing services. Each of these connected services
                    may enable Personal Data about you to be transferred into the VIZI Tech Solutions Services. Generally, these
                    connections are controlled by your Company. But, as described below, you can enable the connection
                    of the VIZI Tech Solutions Services with certain other VIZI Tech Solutions or third party services you select that
                    result in the collection of additional sources of Personal Data.</p>
                <p>When you use the VIZI Tech Solutions Services, some information like IP address, device or browser
                    information, logs or click stream information, for example, is automatically collected about your
                    usage and activity on the VIZI Tech Solutions Service to address technical support issues and understand how
                    you use the VIZI Tech Solutions Services. VIZI Tech Solutions may use certain tracking technologies such as cookies,
                    web beacons, or third party analytics tools to obtain such information.</p>
                <p><strong>What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>
                <p>Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you is the information that is needed to
                    facilitate your queries about our products, travel arrangements and bookings and to arrange
                    travel-related services and products on your behalf. For example, we may collect details such as
                    your name, residential address, mailing address, telephone number, email address, , passport
                    details, frequent flyer details, information about your dietary requirements and health issues (if
                    any), and other details relevant to your travel arrangements or required by the relevant travel
                    service providers (e.g. airlines, accommodation or tour providers). When you make contact with us
                    for other purposes, we may also collect personal information about you in relation to those
                    purposes. For example, we may collect your personal information so we can contact you about a
                    competition you have entered (e.g. if you win) or to respond to an enquiry or feedback form you have
                    sent to us. We also collect information that is required for use in the business activities of
                    VIZI Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd and our related entities, including for example, financial details necessary in
                    order to process various transactions, and any other relevant personal information you may elect to
                    provide to us.</p>
                <p>In some circumstances, we may collect personal information from you which is regarded as sensitive
                    information. Sensitive information includes types of personal information such as your racial or
                    ethnic origin, religious beliefs or affiliations, criminal record and health information. We will
                    only collect sensitive information about you with your consent and where reasonably necessary for,
                    or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities (e.g. to make travel arrangements
                    on your behalf). Where you provide sensitive information to us, you consent to us using that
                    sensitive information for the purpose for which it was collected. For example, if you provide health
                    information to us in connection with a travel insurance application you would like to make, you
                    consent to us using and disclosing that health information in connection with arranging that travel
                    insurance on your behalf.</p>
                <p><strong>When we act as agent</strong></p>
                <p>When we book products and services for you, we usually do so as agent for or on behalf of travel
                    service providers. This means that we usually collect personal information about you both for our
                    internal purposes (e.g. to process your booking), and on behalf of the parties for whom we act as
                    agent, for their internal purposes (e.g. to provide the booked services). Accordingly, the consent
                    you provide under this Policy to the collection and use of personal information by us, applies
                    equally to the parties whose products and services we sell. For example, if you purchase a flight
                    from us, then under this Policy you will have consented to your personal information being provided
                    to the airline to enable your flight to be booked. We act as agent for or on behalf of many
                    thousands of travel service providers, so it is not possible for us to set out in this Policy all of
                    the travel service providers for whom we act nor exactly how each of these travel service providers
                    will use your personal information. If you wish to contact us for further information, please refer
                    to the “Feedback / Complaints / Contact” section below.</p>
                <p><strong>How do we use personal information?</strong></p>
                <p>Where you contact us in relation to a travel booking or query, the primary purpose for which we
                    collect your personal information is generally to provide you with travel advice and/or to assist
                    you with booking travel and/or travel related products and services. However, the purpose for
                    collection may differ depending on the particular circumstances as disclosed in this Policy.</p>
                <p>By providing us, or otherwise allowing us to collect, your personal information, you consent to us
                    using and disclosing your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected, and for
                    related or ancillary purposes, such as any one or more of the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Other purposes as permitted or required by law (e.g. to prevent a threat to life, health or
                        safety).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will only send e-newsletters or other promotional materials to you if you have opted in to receive
                    them. You can subscribe to receive e-newsletters and other promotional materials by following the
                    relevant links on our website.</p>
                <p>We are only allowed to store your personal information for as long as necessary having regard to the
                    purpose for which it was collected or a related or ancillary purpose. We may therefore delete your
                    personal information after a reasonable period of time and, if you have not used our services for
                    some time, you may have to re-enter or re-supply your personal information to us.</p>
                <p><strong>Is personal information disclosed to third parties?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes. You also consent to the personal information about you which we collect or receive being
                    processed, transferred and/or disclosed by us in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In each of the circumstances set out in the previous section “How do we use personal
                        information?”;</li>

                    <li>To various regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials and agencies, including to protect
                        against fraud and for related security purposes;</li>
                    <li>To third party suppliers of IT based solutions that assist us in providing products and services
                        to you;</li>

                    <li>To travel service providers such as travel wholesalers, tour operators, airlines, hotels, car

                        collected or for a related purpose (for example to facilitate and process your travel
                        arrangements);</li>
                    <li>To comply with our legal obligations and any applicable customs/immigration requirements

                    <li>Where we suspect that unlawful activity has been or may be engaged in and the personal

                    relation to collection by travel service providers, see the heading above titled “When we act as
                    agent”.</p>
                <p>Where we engage travel service providers to perform services for us, those travel service providers
                    may be required to handle your personal information. Where we disclose your personal information to
                    such travel service providers, you agree that we will not be required to ensure their compliance
                    with applicable privacy laws or otherwise be liable or accountable for how they handle your personal
                    information.</p>
                <p>Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless we
                    reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a threat to life, health or
                    safety or for certain action to be undertaken by an enforcement body (e.g. prevention, detection,
                    investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences), disclosure is authorised or required
                    by law or disclosure is otherwise permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
                <p>Companies to whom personal information is disclosed which are registered in the United States may be
                    required to provide information under the USA PATRIOT Act H.R. 3162.</p>
                <p><strong>Trans-border data flows</strong></p>
                <p>When you provide, or otherwise allow us to collect, your personal information, you consent to your
                    personal information being disclosed to certain overseas recipients, as set out below. Where we
                    disclose your personal information to an overseas recipient, you acknowledge that the recipient may
                    be located in a country with laws that do not protect personal information as well as Indian privacy
                    laws do. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure the recipient’s compliance with Indian privacy
                    laws; however, you acknowledge that we cannot control the privacy practices of the recipient and
                    therefore will not be liable or accountable for how the recipient handles your personal information.
                    We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party service provider whose services
                    we arrange on your behalf. If you have any objections to your personal information being disclosed
                    to an overseas recipient, please let us know.</p>
                <p>In providing our services to you, it may be necessary for us to disclose personal information to
                    relevant overseas travel service providers. For instance, where you request travel to be booked with
                    an overseas travel service provider, we will usually need to disclose your personal information to
                    that provider for the purposes of arranging your booking with them. These travel service providers
                    will in most cases receive your personal information in the country in which they will provide the
                    services to you or in which their business is based. In providing our services to you, it may be
                    necessary for us to disclose personal information to relevant overseas travel service providers. For
                    instance, where you request travel to be booked with an overseas travel service provider, we will
                    usually need to disclose your personal information to that provider for the purposes of arranging
                    your booking with them. These travel service providers will in most cases receive your personal
                    information in the country in which they will provide the services to you or in which their business
                    is based.</p>
                <p>We may also disclose your personal information to our overseas related entities and to travel service
                    providers and other third parties who perform services for us overseas. Generally, we will only
                    disclose your personal information to these overseas recipients in connection with facilitation of
                    your travel booking and/or to enable the performance of administrative and technical services by
                    them on our behalf.</p>
                <p>We deal with many different service providers all over the world, so it is not possible for us to set
                    out in this Policy all of the different countries to which we may send your personal information.
                    However, if you have any specific questions about where or to whom your personal information will be
                    sent, please refer to the “Feedback / Complaints / Contact” section below.</p>
